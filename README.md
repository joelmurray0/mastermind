## Rules
Two game modes: Duplicate mode and Non-duplicate mode. 
Duplicate mode means that even if all of a certain colour is used up, if it is guessed in the wrong position it will still say it is in the colour code.
Non-duplicate mode means the inverse.
The answer colours are red, orange and green. 
Green signifies correct position and correct colour; orange means that the colour exists in the colour code and red means the colour is not in the code at all.
